## Requirements

In order to use the [Maestro](https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/maestro) framework and this repository template to work without issues, you need to attach a SSH key configure your GitHub account. See the [official GitHub guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) for more information.
